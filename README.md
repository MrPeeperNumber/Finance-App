# Personal Project Finance App

## About
This is a personal project I started to help build my portfolio, practice coding, and learning more. This is going to be a full-stack project that will likely take quite a long time to come to fruition. I currently only know a moderate amount of C++, and some NodeJS. I have plans on making this app completely out of C++, however that is not set in stone, depending on whether or not other people are brought in on the project.

## Plans
Currently, there is no functionality to the project, nor does it actually compile. I am working on building the barebone skeleton of the app (objects, etc.). Much of what's there has been tested *to a degree*.

* Finish writing implementation file for `Item` objects
* Write implementation/header file for `Calcs` object
* Write implementation/header file for `MonthExp` object
* Write implementation/header file for `Date` objects
* Write implementation/header file for `Category` objects
* Write implementation/header file for `addUser` object
* Write implementation/header file for `rmUser` object
* Add some form of functionality to the driver
* Start using CMake instead of Makefile

## Farther Future Plans
* Containerize using Docker
* Add database functionality
* Add password hashing and secure storage
* Add some kind of API functionality for future implementation of a front-end
* Add front-end functionality using either C++ or JS
* Add asynchronous functionality to app
* Transform app into microservices over monolithic
